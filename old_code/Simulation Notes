To get accurate results:
    - The interferogram needs to be centred about the null point to give the
      correct results, otehriwse they are all shifted off
    - There is a maximum step distance that still gives good results
    
Potential Extensions:
    - Find the final values using code instead of manually
    - Fit the two peaks at the end
    - Investigate the fourier shifts and why they are needed
    - How many lines can you add?
    - How does line thickness effect the interferogram and the final results?
    - How smooth can you get the final peaks? How should you adjust your 
      experiment to get the best results possible?
